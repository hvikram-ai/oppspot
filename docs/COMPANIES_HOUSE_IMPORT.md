## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Apply Database Migration

**Before importing**, run this SQL in Supabase:

https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fuqdbewftdthbjfcecrz/sql/new

```sql
-- Paste contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/20251003180000_add_companies_house_fields.sql
```

This adds Companies House specific fields to your `businesses` table.

### 2. Check Current Database Size

```sql
SELECT
  pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('postgres')) as total_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('businesses')) as businesses_table_size;
```

Make sure you have room within 500MB limit!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Import Gets Stuck

- **Check:** Browser dev tools console for errors
- **Solution:** Cancel and restart
- **Note:** Import resumes from start (no checkpoints yet)

### Database Size Limit Exceeded

- **Check:** Current database size in Supabase dashboard
- **Solution 1:** Tighten filters (fewer SIC codes, recent dates)
- **Solution 2:** Upgrade to Supabase Pro ($25/month)

### Import Errors

Common errors shown in progress:
- `errorRows` count increasing - batch insert failures
- Check Supabase logs for details
- Usually: duplicate keys, validation errors

### No Progress Updates

- Refresh the page
- Check if import is still running: `/api/admin/companies-house/import`
- Poll interval: 2 seconds

## üí° Tips

### Best Practices:

1. **Test first** - Use "Test Import" with sample data
2. **Monitor closely** - Watch first few batches for errors
3. **Off-peak hours** - Import during low traffic (saves API quota)
4. **Backup first** - Export current businesses table before import

### Performance:

- **Batch size:** 1,000 companies (configurable in code)
- **Processing speed:** ~1,000-2,000 rows/second
- **Network:** Download is slowest part (~5GB file)

### Storage Optimization:

- Companies House data compresses well
