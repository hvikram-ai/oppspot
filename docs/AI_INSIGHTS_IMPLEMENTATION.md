# AI-Generated Stream Insights Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented AI-powered insight generation for Streams, providing users with real-time recommendations, progress analysis, quality assessments, and risk alerts.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Insight Generator Service (`lib/agents/insight-generator.ts`)

A comprehensive AI-powered analysis engine that:

- **Analyzes stream metrics**: progress %, quality scores, completion rates
- **Evaluates agent performance**: success rates, execution speed, quality output
- **Detects patterns**: declining quality, slowing progress, bottlenecks
- **Generates actionable insights** across 6 categories:
  - **Progress Updates** - "On track to meet goal" / "Behind schedule"
  - **Quality Assessments** - "Excellent quality results!" / "Quality below target"
  - **Recommendations** - "Add enrichment agent" / "Adjust search criteria"
  - **Risk Alerts** - "Goal at risk - deadline approaching"
  - **Milestone Achievements** - "50% milestone reached!"
  - **Optimizations** - "Workflow bottleneck detected in Research stage"

### 2. Insight Types & Examples

#### Progress Insights
- **25%, 50%, 75% milestones** - Celebrates achievements
- **Pace tracking** - "At current pace, you'll reach goal 3 days early"
- **Acceleration alerts** - "Need to increase discovery rate"

#### Quality Insights
- **Quality exceeding target** - "Average 4.5/5 exceeds target of 3.5/5"
- **Quality below target** - "Consider adding scoring/enrichment agents"
- **Quality stabilization** - "Quality score stabilized after 20 items"

#### Risk Alerts
- **Deadline risks** - "Need 5 items/day but current rate is 2/day"
- **Agent performance** - "OpportunityBot showing low success rate"

#### Optimization Suggestions
- **Agent recommendations** - "Add OpportunityBot for automation"
- **Enhancement suggestions** - "Add Enrichment Agent for better data"
- **Workflow optimizations** - "70% of items stuck in Qualify stage"

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Manual Insight Generation
```
POST /api/streams/[id]/insights/generate
```
Triggers on-demand insight generation for a stream.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "insights": [...],
  "count": 5,
  "message": "Generated 5 insights successfully"
}
```

### 4. Automatic Insight Generation

**OpportunityBot Integration** - Automatically generates insights after each execution:
- Analyzes results (items created, quality scores)
- Compares against goals and targets
- Creates relevant insights
- Stores in database with execution context

**Trigger Points:**
- After agent execution completes successfully
- When milestones are reached (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- When quality thresholds are crossed
- When deadlines approach with low progress

### 5. UI Components

#### Stream Dashboard Enhancements

**New "Generate Insights" Button:**
- Located in dashboard header
- Brain icon with pulse animation when generating
- Triggers manual insight generation
- Auto-refreshes dashboard to show new insights

**Insight Action Handlers:**
- Mark as read
- Take action (marks actionable insights as addressed)
- Dismiss (marks as read)
- All actions update database and refresh UI

#### Insights Tab Features
- Filter by: All, Unread, Actionable
- Color-coded by severity (info, success, warning, critical)
- Displays insight data in expandable cards
- Shows which agent generated each insight
- Action buttons for actionable insights

## Database Schema

**stream_insights table** (already exists):
```sql
- id (UUID)
- stream_id (UUID, FK to streams)
- insight_type (enum: progress_update, quality_assessment, etc.)
- title (text)
- description (text)
- severity (enum: info, success, warning, critical)
- data (JSONB) - Additional insight data
- generated_by (text) - 'system' or agent_id
- agent_execution_id (UUID, FK to agent_executions)
- is_read (boolean)
- is_actionable (boolean)
- action_taken (boolean)
- action_taken_at (timestamp)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

## Files Created/Modified

## Usage Guide

### For Developers

**Generate insights programmatically:**
```typescript
import { InsightGenerator } from '@/lib/agents/insight-generator'

// Generate insights for a stream
const insights = await InsightGenerator.generateInsights(streamId, executionId)

// Insights are automatically saved to database
console.log(`Generated ${insights.length} insights`)
```

**Add insight generation to new agents:**
```typescript
// In your agent's execute() method, after completion:
try {
  const { InsightGenerator } = await import('./insight-generator')
  await InsightGenerator.generateInsights(stream_id, context.executionId)
  this.log('Generated insights for stream')
} catch (error) {
  this.log(`Failed to generate insights: ${error.message}`, 'warn')
}
```

### For Users

**Manual Insight Generation:**
1. Navigate to Stream Dashboard
2. Click "Generate Insights" button (top right)
3. Wait for generation to complete
4. View new insights in Insights tab

**Automatic Insights:**
- Insights are automatically generated when agents complete execution
- Check the Insights tab to see all recommendations
- Filter by "Unread" or "Action Required" to focus on important items

**Taking Action on Insights:**
1. Go to Insights tab
2. Review actionable insights (marked with action buttons)
3. Click "Take Action" to mark as addressed
4. Click "Dismiss" to mark as read without action
