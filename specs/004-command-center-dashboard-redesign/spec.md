## üìã Quick Guidelines
- ‚úì Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚úó Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- = Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## üéØ Vision Statement

Transform oppSpot's dashboard from a **static information display** into a **proactive command center** that:
- Shows immediate value and ROI within 30 seconds of login
- Guides users through goal-oriented workflows (not feature lists)
- Surfaces AI-powered insights and opportunities automatically
- Makes premium features (ResearchGPT‚Ñ¢, Opp Scan) impossible to miss
- Feels best-in-class compared to enterprise tools at 10x the price

**North Star Metric**: New users understand oppSpot's value and complete their first action within 60 seconds of login.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story #1: The Confused New User

**Actor**: Emma, new SDR who just signed up for oppSpot

**Current Experience (Problem)**:
Emma logs in for the first time and sees:
- A greeting header with her name
- Four stat cards showing "0" everywhere (she has no data yet)
- A "Quick Actions" section with 8 buttons she doesn't understand
- A navigation bar with 10+ links she's never heard of (Benchmarking? Qualification? Stakeholders?)
- No clear indication of what to do first or why oppSpot is valuable

She thinks: "This looks like every other boring B2B tool. Where do I start? What makes this worth ¬£99/month?"

**New Experience (Solution)**:
Emma logs in and immediately sees:
- **Smart Welcome Card**: "Hi Emma! Let's find your first opportunity in 60 seconds ‚ö°"
  - Big, obvious "Start Discovery Search" button
  - Or: "Generate Research Report on a Company"
- **Value Proposition Banner**: "Save 10 hours/week on prospect research. Here's how:"
  - Three visual workflow cards showing exactly how oppSpot works
- **Guided Tour Option**: "Take a 2-minute tour" vs "I know what I'm doing"
- **Empty State Guidance**: Instead of "0" stats, cards show "Complete your first search to see metrics here"

She thinks: "Oh! This tool helps me find and research companies fast. Let me try it."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úì New users with zero activity see contextual onboarding
- ‚úì Clear call-to-action above the fold
- ‚úì Value proposition visible within first 3 seconds
- ‚úì Optional guided tour available
- ‚úì Empty states are helpful, not depressing

---

### Primary User Story #2: The Overwhelmed Power User

**Actor**: James, sales manager using oppSpot daily with active campaigns

**Current Experience (Problem)**:
James logs in and sees:
- The same static dashboard every day
- Stats that require mental math to understand ("Is 1,234 searches good or bad?")
- No prioritization of what needs his attention
- Has to manually navigate to 5+ different sections to check his pipeline
- Misses important opportunities because they're buried in "Recent Activity"

He thinks: "I'm paying ¬£99/month but still spending 30 minutes each morning checking everything manually."

**New Experience (Solution)**:
James logs in and immediately sees:
- **AI Daily Digest** (top of page, impossible to miss):
  - "üî• 12 high-priority opportunities found overnight by OpportunityBot"
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è 3 hot leads haven't been contacted in 5+ days"
  - "‚ú® ResearchGPT‚Ñ¢ completed 4 reports while you slept"
- **Priority Queue**: Smart to-do list ranked by urgency and potential value
  - "Contact TechCorp Ltd (87% fit score, hiring signals detected)"
  - "Review research report for Monzo (expires in 2 days)"
- **Impact Metrics** (not vanity metrics):
  - "You've saved 8.5 hours this week vs manual research"
  - "¬£45k in pipeline sourced from oppSpot leads"
- **Quick Actions Scoped to His Context**:
  - "Resume search: Tech startups in London" (his last search)
  - "Check Manchester territory map" (he searches there often)

He thinks: "This tool knows what I need to do today. It's like having an assistant."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úì AI-generated daily digest shows overnight discoveries
- ‚úì Priority queue ranks actions by urgency and value
- ‚úì Metrics show impact (time saved, revenue) not just activity counts
- ‚úì Contextual quick actions based on user history
- ‚úì Nothing requires more than 2 clicks to access

### Primary User Story #3: The Mobile Manager

**Actor**: Sarah, VP of Sales checking dashboard on her phone during commute

**Current Experience (Problem)**:
Sarah opens oppSpot on her phone and sees:
- Tiny navigation buttons that are hard to tap
- Horizontal scrolling tables that are impossible to read
- Stats cards in a 4-column grid that's unreadable on mobile
- No clear hierarchy of what's important

She thinks: "This is unusable on mobile. I'll check it when I get to my desk."

**New Experience (Solution)**:
Sarah opens oppSpot on her phone and sees:
- **Mobile-Optimized Priority Card** at top:
  - "8 opportunities need your attention" with expand/collapse
- **Swipeable Stat Cards**: One at a time, swipe to see next
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Easy thumb access to key sections
- **Simplified View**: Only most critical info shown, with "View Full Dashboard" option
- **Quick Actions as FAB** (Floating Action Button):
  - Tap to reveal 3-4 most common actions

She thinks: "I can actually use this on the go. Let me check those 8 opportunities."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úì Fully responsive design (mobile-first)
- ‚úì Bottom navigation for mobile users
- ‚úì Swipeable cards instead of grids
- ‚úì Progressive disclosure (details hidden until needed)
- ‚úì Touch-friendly targets (min 44x44px)

---

**Current Experience (Problem)**:
Tom logs in specifically to try the new ResearchGPT‚Ñ¢ feature he heard about.
- It's not visible anywhere on the dashboard
- Navigation bar has 10 items, none called "Research"
- He clicks around randomly: Companies? Analytics? Lists?
- After 5 minutes, he gives up and emails support

He thinks: "If the feature exists, why can't I find it? Is it premium-only?"

**New Experience (Solution)**:
Tom logs in and immediately sees:
- **Feature Spotlight Card** (rotating highlights):
  - "üß† NEW: ResearchGPT‚Ñ¢ - Deep company intelligence in 30 seconds"
  - Big "Try It Now" button
  - Shows he has 100/100 credits remaining
- **Navigation**: Clear "Intelligence" section with ResearchGPT‚Ñ¢ prominently listed
- **Quick Action**: "Generate Research" card in top 3 actions

## Clarifications Needed

### ü§î Question 1: Dashboard Customization
**Question**: Should users be able to fully customize their dashboard (drag-and-drop cards, show/hide sections), or should we provide role-based presets with limited customization?

**Options**:
A. **Full Customization**: Users can rearrange any card, show/hide, resize (like Notion)
B. **Role Presets + Minor Tweaks**: Smart defaults by role, users can only toggle visibility
C. **Fixed Layout**: No customization, optimized layout for everyone

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (Role Presets + Minor Tweaks)
- **Why**: Full customization is complex to build and most users won't use it. Fixed layout is too rigid. Role presets give 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity.

**Decision**: [ ] Pending stakeholder input

---

### ü§î Question 2: AI Digest Frequency
**Question**: How often should the AI Digest regenerate?

**Options**:
A. **Daily** (every morning at 8am user's timezone)
B. **Real-time** (updates every hour with new discoveries)
C. **Configurable** (user sets preference)

**Recommendation**: **Option A** (Daily at 8am)
- **Why**: Creates a predictable routine ("check my digest every morning"). Real-time can be overwhelming. Configurable adds complexity for marginal benefit.

**Decision**: [ ] Pending stakeholder input

---

### ü§î Question 3: Mobile App vs PWA
**Question**: Should we build a native mobile app or optimize the web app as a PWA?

**Options**:
A. **Native iOS/Android apps**
B. **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - installable, offline-capable web app
C. **Both**

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (PWA)
- **Why**: PWA gives 90% of native experience with one codebase. Can always build native later if needed. Faster to market.

**Decision**: [ ] Pending stakeholder input

---

### ü§î Question 4: Priority Queue Algorithm
**Question**: How should we rank items in the Priority Queue?

**Options**:
A. **Simple Recency**: Most recent first (easy to implement)
B. **AI-Powered Scoring**: Use ML model to predict conversion likelihood
C. **Rule-Based Scoring**: Manual formula (opportunity value √ó urgency √ó fit / age)

**Recommendation**: **Option C** initially, evolve to **Option B**
- **Why**: Start with rule-based (predictable, explainable), collect data, then train ML model over time.

**Decision**: [ ] Pending stakeholder input

---

### ü§î Question 5: Feature Spotlight Rotation
**Question**: How should we decide which features to spotlight?

**Options**:
A. **Manual Curation**: Product team picks featured items weekly
B. **Usage-Based**: Show features user hasn't tried yet
C. **A/B Testing**: Rotate randomly, measure engagement

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (Usage-Based)
- **Why**: Most relevant to each user. Ensures everyone discovers all features over time.

**Decision**: [ ] Pending stakeholder input

---

### ü§î Question 6: Empty State Strategy
**Question**: What should new users with no data see?

**Options**:
A. **Sample Data**: Show demo data until they have real data
B. **Empty State Messages**: Helpful guides like "Complete your first search to see metrics"
C. **Interactive Tutorial**: Step-by-step walkthrough

**Recommendation**: **Option B + C** (Empty states with optional tutorial)
- **Why**: Sample data can be confusing ("is this my data?"). Empty states are clear. Tutorial for users who want guidance.

**Decision**: [ ] Pending stakeholder input

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Value First, Features Second
- Show business impact (time saved, revenue) before technical capabilities
- Lead with outcomes ("Find opportunities faster") not features ("Advanced search filters")

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Show essentials by default, details on demand
- Don't overwhelm with everything at once
- Clear path to "learn more" for curious users

### 3. Zero Ambiguity
- Every button clearly states what happens when clicked
- No jargon without tooltips
- Success states confirm actions ("Research report generated ‚úì")

### 4. Speed Over Perfection
- Show cached data immediately, update with fresh data
- Optimistic UI (assume success, rollback if fails)
- Never block user with loading spinners when avoidable

### 5. Intelligent Defaults
- Role-based presets that work for 80% of users
- Learn from user behavior (frequently used features rise to top)
- One-click to common actions, two clicks to everything else

---
