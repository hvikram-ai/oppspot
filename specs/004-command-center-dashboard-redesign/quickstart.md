## Common Issues & Debugging

### Issue: Dashboard loads slowly (>3s)
**Debug**:
```bash
# Check bundle size
npm run build
# Look for: Page Size First Load JS
# Dashboard should be <200KB

# Profile with React DevTools
# Check for: unnecessary re-renders
```

**Fix**:
- Add React.memo() to expensive components
- Lazy load below-fold content
- Optimize images (use Next.js Image component)

### Issue: Priority queue doesn't update
**Debug**:
```bash
# Check Supabase Realtime subscription
# Components > PriorityQueue > useEffect
# Should see: "subscribed to priority_queue_items"
```

**Fix**:
- Verify RLS policies allow SELECT
- Check Supabase Realtime enabled for table
- Add error logging to subscription

### Issue: Metrics show "0" or incorrect values
**Debug**:
```sql
-- Check data in Supabase
SELECT * FROM dashboard_metrics
WHERE user_id = 'current-user-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Fix**:
- Verify metric calculation functions
- Check date range filters
- Ensure user has activity data

### Issue: Mobile bottom nav overlaps content
**Debug**:
```css
/* Check if padding-bottom applied to body */
body {
  padding-bottom: 60px; /* Height of bottom nav */
}
```

**Fix**:
- Add safe-area-inset-bottom for iOS
- Use fixed positioning correctly
- Test on actual device (not just DevTools)
