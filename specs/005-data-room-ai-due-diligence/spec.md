# Feature Specification: Data Room - AI-Powered Due Diligence Platform

**Feature Branch**: `005-data-room-ai-due-diligence`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P0 - Strategic (Most Valuable Feature)
**Input**: "Data Room within Diligence where users can upload documents and get AI-powered analytics"

## Executive Summary

The **Data Room** is a revolutionary AI-powered due diligence platform that transforms oppSpot from a business discovery tool into an **end-to-end M&A intelligence platform**. Users can upload confidential documents (financials, contracts, pitch decks, legal docs) into secure data rooms and receive instant AI analysis that would traditionally take analysts weeks to complete.

### Market Opportunity

- **UK M&A Market**: £150B+ annual deal volume
- **Due Diligence Costs**: 0.5-2% of deal size (£750k-3M for £150M deal)
- **Time Savings**: AI reduces manual review by 80% (weeks → days)
- **Competitive Landscape**: Ansarada, Datasite, Intralinks charge $10k-50k per deal
- **oppSpot Advantage**: We uniquely combine external company intelligence (ResearchGPT™) with internal document analysis

### Business Impact

- **Revenue**: Justifies premium tier ($199/month) + usage-based pricing ($50 per data room)
- **Market Expansion**: Capture M&A advisors, PE firms, corporate development teams
- **Competitive Moat**: AI document intelligence is defensible technology
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: 3-5x increase from strategic accounts

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**Alex, Corporate Development Director at a £50M SaaS company**, is evaluating 3 acquisition targets. For each company, she needs to:
1. Review 200-500 pages of financial statements (P&L, balance sheets, cash flow)
2. Analyze 50+ contracts (customer agreements, vendor contracts, employment agreements)
3. Identify legal risks, missing clauses, unusual obligations
4. Calculate key financial metrics and detect anomalies
5. Synthesize findings into an executive summary

**Current Process**:
- 2 weeks per company with a junior analyst
- £10k+ in consulting fees for financial analysis
- Risk of missing critical red flags in contract fine print
- No systematic way to track what's been reviewed

**With Data Room**:
1. Alex creates a new data room for "Target Company A"
2. She drags & drops 247 documents into the upload zone
3. AI automatically classifies documents: 43 financials, 67 contracts, 52 due diligence, 85 other
4. Within 5 minutes, AI generates:
   - Financial health scorecard (revenue trends, burn rate, runway)
   - Contract risk report (19 high-priority issues identified)
   - Missing documents checklist (no IP assignment agreements found)
   - Executive summary with deal recommendation
5. Alex shares data room with CFO (view-only) and legal counsel (comment access)
6. She repeats for all 3 targets in 1 day instead of 6 weeks

**Result**: £25k saved, 5 weeks faster, higher confidence decision, full audit trail

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### AC-001: Create Data Room
**Given** a user is on the Diligence page
**When** they click "Create Data Room"
**Then** they see a modal to name the room, select a target company (optional), and set permissions
**And** a new empty data room is created with a unique URL

#### AC-002: Upload Documents
**Given** a user is viewing a data room
**When** they drag & drop files or click "Upload Documents"
**Then** files are uploaded with progress indicators
**And** each file is encrypted and stored in Supabase Storage
**And** a database record is created with metadata (filename, size, type, uploader, timestamp)
**And** AI classification starts automatically in the background

#### AC-003: AI Document Classification
**Given** a document has been uploaded
**When** AI analysis completes (30-60 seconds)
**Then** the document is tagged with: document_type (financial, contract, due_diligence, other), confidence_score, extracted_metadata
**And** user sees classification in the document list with colored badge

#### AC-004: View Document with AI Insights
**Given** a user clicks on a classified document
**When** the document viewer loads
**Then** they see the original document (PDF viewer) with AI-generated sidebar showing:
- Key information extracted (dates, amounts, parties, obligations)
- Risk highlights (unusual clauses, missing terms, compliance issues)
- Quick summary (3-5 bullet points)
- Related documents in data room

#### AC-005: Financial Analysis Dashboard
**Given** a data room contains 10+ financial documents
**When** user clicks "Financial Analysis" tab
**Then** they see a comprehensive dashboard with:
- Revenue trend chart (last 3 years)
- Burn rate and runway calculator
- Key metrics table (gross margin, CAC, LTV, churn)
- Anomaly detection alerts (unusual spikes, missing periods)
- Benchmark comparison vs. industry standards

#### AC-006: Contract Intelligence Report
**Given** a data room contains 5+ contracts

- Documents missing (marked red with "Request from seller" button)
- Documents partially complete (marked yellow with details)
- Suggested follow-up questions based on findings

#### AC-008: Share Data Room with Team
**Given** a user owns a data room
**When** they click "Share" and enter team member emails
**Then** they can assign permissions per user:
- **Owner**: Full access, can delete data room
- **Editor**: Upload, annotate, generate reports
- **Viewer**: Read-only, can download with watermark
- **Commenter**: Can add notes/questions but not download
**And** invited users receive email notification with secure link

#### AC-009: Activity Audit Log
**Given** a user is viewing a data room
**When** they click "Activity" tab
**Then** they see a timestamped log of:

**And** a formatted report is generated and downloaded with company branding

#### AC-011: Integration with ResearchGPT™
**Given** a data room is linked to a company in oppSpot
**When** AI generates analysis
**Then** it cross-references findings with:
- ResearchGPT™ company snapshot (compare claimed vs. actual financials)
- Buying signals (validate hiring claims with job postings)
- Decision makers (verify signatures on contracts match known executives)
**And** highlights discrepancies (e.g., "Revenue claim 30% higher than external estimates")

#### AC-012: Security & Compliance
**Given** sensitive documents are uploaded
**When** stored and accessed
**Then** all documents are encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
**And** user can enable 2FA for data room access
**And** user can set expiration dates for shared links
**And** watermarks are applied to downloaded PDFs with user name + timestamp
**And** activity logs are immutable (append-only, cannot be edited)

### Edge Cases

1. **Large file uploads**: What happens when user uploads a 500MB PDF with 1000 pages?
   - **Resolution**: 100MB per file limit, show progress bar, process in background, send notification when complete

2. **Scanned documents (images)**: How does AI analyze handwritten or poor-quality scans?
   - **Resolution**: Use OCR (Tesseract) to extract text first, flag low-confidence extractions for manual review

3. **Non-English documents**: Can AI analyze documents in Welsh, Gaelic, or foreign languages?
   - **Resolution**: Phase 1 supports English only, Phase 2 adds multilingual OCR + translation

4. **Corrupted or password-protected files**: What if a PDF is encrypted or won't open?
   - **Resolution**: Prompt user to provide password or re-upload, log as "Failed to process"

5. **Conflicting financial data**: If multiple versions of financials exist, which is authoritative?
   - **Resolution**: Show all versions, flag conflicts, let user mark one as "Source of Truth"

6. **Data room deleted**: What happens to uploaded documents and analysis?
   - **Resolution**: Soft delete (mark as deleted, hide from UI) for 30 days, then hard delete after retention period

7. **GDPR compliance**: How to handle personal data in contracts (employee names, emails)?
   - **Resolution**: Detect PII, offer redaction tool, auto-delete after deal closes (user-configurable)

8. **Concurrent editing**: If 2 users annotate the same document simultaneously?
   - **Resolution**: Phase 1 last-write-wins, Phase 2 real-time collaboration with Supabase Realtime
