# Data Room - AI-Powered Due Diligence Platform

**Feature ID**: 005
**Status**: 📋 Specification Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Priority**: P0 - Strategic (Most Valuable Feature)
**Created**: 2025-10-01

---

## 🎯 Overview

The **Data Room** transforms oppSpot from a business discovery platform into a complete **M&A intelligence system**. Users can upload confidential deal documents (financials, contracts, due diligence materials) into secure, encrypted data rooms and receive **instant AI analysis** that traditionally takes weeks and costs tens of thousands of pounds.

### Why This is the Most Valuable Feature

**Market Opportunity**:
- UK M&A market: **£150B+ annual deal volume**
- Due diligence costs: **0.5-2% of deal size** (£750k-3M for £150M deal)
- AI reduces manual review by **80%** (weeks → days)
- Competitive VDRs (Ansarada, Datasite): **$10k-50k per deal**

**oppSpot's Unique Advantage**:
- We **already have ResearchGPT™** AI infrastructure
- We have **external company intelligence** (buying signals, company data)
- We can **cross-reference internal documents with external data** for unprecedented insights
- Example: "Revenue claim in pitch deck is 30% higher than external estimates"

**Business Impact**:
- **Revenue**: Justifies Premium tier ($199/month) + usage-based pricing ($50 per data room)
- **Market Expansion**: Capture M&A advisors, PE firms, corporate development teams
- **Competitive Moat**: AI document intelligence is defensible, hard-to-replicate technology
- **Customer LTV**: 3-5x increase from strategic accounts
