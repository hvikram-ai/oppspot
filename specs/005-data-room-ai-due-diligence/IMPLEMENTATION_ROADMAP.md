## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: AI accuracy <90%
- **Mitigation**: Test with 100+ diverse documents before beta launch, human review loop for low-confidence classifications

**Risk**: Performance issues with large files (>50MB)
- **Mitigation**: Implement streaming uploads, background processing, CDN for downloads

**Risk**: Security vulnerability discovered
- **Mitigation**: Weekly security scans, penetration testing before each launch, bug bounty program

### Schedule Risks

**Risk**: Phase 1 delayed (Week 9+ delivery)
- **Mitigation**: Cut scope (remove annotations from Phase 1, move to Phase 4)

**Risk**: Beta feedback requires major changes
- **Mitigation**: 2-week buffer built into timeline, prioritize critical fixes only

**Risk**: AI model performance degradation
- **Mitigation**: Monitor accuracy metrics weekly, switch to alternative model if needed (GPT-4, Gemini)
