## 🎯 The Opportunity

### Market Size
- **UK M&A Market**: £150B+ annual deal volume
- **Due Diligence Spend**: 0.5-2% of deal value = **£750k-3M per £150M deal**
- **Current Pain**: Manual review takes **2-6 weeks**, requires expensive consultants
- **Market Leaders**: Ansarada, Datasite charge **$10k-50k per deal**

### The Problem We Solve

**Alex, Corporate Development Director**, needs to evaluate 3 acquisition targets:
- Review **200-500 pages of financials** per company
- Analyze **50+ contracts** for each target
- Current process: **2 weeks per company**, **£10k+ in consulting fees**
- Risk: **Missing critical red flags** buried in fine print

**Traditional Due Diligence Process**:
```
Week 1-2:  Junior analyst manually reads financials
           → Extract revenue, margins, cash flow
           → Build Excel models
           → Cost: £5k-10k

Week 3-4:  Legal team reviews contracts
           → Identify risks, missing clauses
           → Highlight unusual terms
           → Cost: £10k-20k

Week 5-6:  Senior analyst synthesizes findings
           → Create executive summary
           → Make recommendations
           → Cost: £5k-10k

Total: 6 weeks, £20k-40k per target
```

## 🚀 Unique Competitive Advantage

### What Makes Us Different

**Traditional VDRs** (Ansarada, Datasite, Intralinks):
- ❌ Document storage + basic collaboration only
- ❌ No AI analysis beyond simple OCR
- ❌ No external validation
- ❌ Expensive ($10k-50k per deal)

**oppSpot Data Room**:
- ✅ **AI Document Intelligence**: Financial analysis, contract risks, anomaly detection
- ✅ **External Cross-Referencing**: Compare internal docs with ResearchGPT™ research
- ✅ **Integrated Platform**: Discovery → Research → Due Diligence in one tool
- ✅ **Affordable**: $199/month flat fee

### The "Aha!" Moment

**Cross-Referencing Internal + External Data**:

```
Internal Document (Pitch Deck):
"Revenue: £12M in 2024, growing 150% YoY"

ResearchGPT™ External Research:
"Last filed accounts: £8M revenue (2023)"
"No recent funding announcements"
"Hiring freeze detected (0 job postings in 90 days)"

🚨 AI Alert:
"Revenue claim £12M is 50% higher than external estimates.
Growth claim 150% not supported by market signals.
Recommend: Request audited financials for verification."
```
