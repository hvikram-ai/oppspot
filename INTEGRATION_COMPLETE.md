# 🎉 Goal-Oriented Streams Integration Complete!

## Overview

The goal-oriented AI agent system has been **fully integrated** into the existing stream wizard. Users can now create streams as goal-tracking workspaces with AI automation.

---

## ✅ What Was Integrated

### **1. Enhanced Stream Wizard** (`components/streams/stream-wizard.tsx`)

**New Steps Added:**
- Step 2: **Goal Setup** (goal_template) - Select template & set deadline
- Step 3: **Define Goal** (goal_criteria) - Build ICP criteria & targets
- Step 4: **AI Agents** (agents) - Assign and configure agents

**Smart Step Flow:**
- If user enables "Goal-Oriented": Shows all 8 steps (with goal steps)
- If user skips it: Shows only 5 steps (traditional workflow)

**Updated Submission Logic:**
- Goal-oriented streams → `POST /api/streams/goal`
- Regular streams → Uses existing `onComplete` handler

---

### **2. New Wizard Step Components**

#### `wizard-steps/goal-template-step.tsx`
- Toggle for enabling goal-oriented mode
- Goal template selector (fetches from API)
- Deadline picker
- Auto-populates criteria from template

#### `wizard-steps/goal-criteria-step.tsx`
- Wraps `GoalCriteriaBuilder` component
- Industry, location, revenue filters
- Target metrics (companies to find, quality score)
- Success criteria (min qualified, researched)

#### `wizard-steps/agents-step.tsx`
- Auto-assign toggle
- Agent configuration panel
- Shows suggested agents from template
- Configure execution frequency & role

---

### **3. Updated Types** (`types/stream-wizard.ts`)

**New Fields in `StreamWizardData`:**
```typescript
{
  // Goal-oriented fields
  isGoalOriented: boolean
  goal_template_id: string | null
  goal_deadline: string | null
  goal_criteria: GoalCriteria
  target_metrics: TargetMetrics
  success_criteria: SuccessCriteria
  assign_agents: boolean
  assigned_agents: AssignedAgentConfig[]
}
```

**New Step Types:**
```typescript
type StreamWizardStep =
  | 'basics'
  | 'goal_template'  // NEW
  | 'goal_criteria'  // NEW
  | 'agents'         // NEW
  | 'workflow'
  | 'team'
  | 'integration'
  | 'review'
```

## 🎯 User Journey

### **Creating a Goal-Oriented Stream**

**Step 1: Basics**
```
Name: "Find 50 UK SaaS Acquisition Targets"
Type: Project
Emoji: 🎯
```

**Step 2: Goal Setup**
```
[x] Enable Goal-Oriented Automation
Template: "Acquisition Targets" 🎯
Deadline: 2025-11-01
```

**Step 3: Define Goal (ICP Criteria)**
```
Industry: [SaaS, Fintech]
Location: [UK]
Revenue: £1M - £10M
Growth: >50% YoY
Employees: 10-100

Target Metrics:
- Companies to find: 50
- Min quality score: 4.0

Success Criteria:
- Min qualified: 30
- Min researched: 20
```

**Step 4: AI Agents**
```
[x] Auto-assign recommended agents

Assigned Agents:
✅ OpportunityBot™ (Primary) - Daily execution
✅ ResearchGPT™ (Enrichment) - Weekly execution
✅ ScoringAgent (Scoring) - On-demand
```

**Step 5-8:** Standard workflow, team, integration, review steps

**Result:**
```
POST /api/streams/goal
→ Stream created with goal_criteria
→ 3 agents assigned and configured
→ Goal status: "in_progress"
→ Progress: 0/50 (0%)
→ Agents start working autonomously
```

## 🔥 Key Features

### **Conditional Wizard Flow**
- Toggle in Step 2 enables/disables goal-oriented mode
- Dynamically shows/hides steps 2-4 based on toggle
- Step indicator updates to show only relevant steps

### **Template Auto-Population**
- Selecting a template auto-fills:
  - `goal_criteria` (industry, revenue, etc.)
  - `target_metrics` (companies to find, quality score)
  - `success_criteria` (min qualified, researched)
  - `assigned_agents` (suggested agents with configs)

### **API Integration**
- Wizard automatically detects goal-oriented mode
- Calls `/api/streams/goal` for goal streams
- Calls existing endpoint for regular streams
- Seamless switching between modes
