ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Blocking)

  1. TypeScript Errors (60+ errors)

  - Next.js 15 route params not async: Routes like
  /api/companies/by-number-temp/enrich/route.ts expecting sync params but
  Next.js 15 requires Promise<params>
  - Database type mismatches: Two conflicting database type definitions
  (types/database.ts vs lib/supabase/database.types.ts)
  - Missing properties: Properties like acquisition_scans, scan_audit_log,
  market_intelligence, scan_reports don't exist in database types
  - Type conflicts: Companies page has incompatible types between different
  Company interfaces

  2. Build Breaking Issues

  - Companies page (app/(dashboard)/companies/page.tsx:97): setEnrichedData
  not defined
  - Qualification page: Type mismatches in activity logs
  - Admin pages: Missing role property checks

  ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority

  3. ESLint Warnings (30+ warnings)

  - @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: 11 occurrences - untyped any usage
  - react-hooks/exhaustive-deps: Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
  - Unused variables/imports: Cluttering codebase

  4. Architecture Issues

  - Hardcoded credentials in client code (lib/supabase/client.ts:6-7) -
  security risk
  - Duplicate database type definitions causing conflicts
  - Inconsistent error handling across API routes

  ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Code Quality)

  - Unused eslint-disable directives
  - Dead code (unused imports)
  - React unescaped entities (already disabled in ESLint)

  ðŸ“‹ Recommended Action Plan

  Immediate (to restore builds):
  1. Fix async params in Next.js 15 routes
  2. Consolidate database types (single source of truth)
  3. Fix undefined setEnrichedData in companies page
  4. Add missing database tables to schema or remove references

  Short-term:
  5. Replace all any types with proper interfaces
  6. Fix useEffect dependency arrays
  7. Remove unused imports/variables

  Long-term:
  8. Move credentials to environment variables (security)
  9. Add comprehensive error boundaries
  10. Implement proper TypeScript strict mode throughout
