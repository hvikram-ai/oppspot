## Week 2: AI Agents Infrastructure ✅

### Database Schema
- **ai_agents**: Agent configuration and scheduling
- **agent_executions**: Execution history with metrics
- **buying_signals**: Detected signals for companies
- **agent_tasks**: Task queue for async execution

### Agents Implemented

#### 1. BaseAgent (Abstract Class)
**File**: `lib/ai/agents/base-agent.ts`
- Lifecycle management (run, schedule, logging)
- Event emission
- Buying signal creation
- Metrics tracking

#### 2. Scout Agent
**File**: `lib/ai/agents/scout-agent.ts`
**Purpose**: Monitor companies for buying signals 24/7

**Detects**:
- Job postings (hiring signals)
- Companies House filings
- News mentions
- Funding rounds
- Executive changes

**Usage**:
```typescript
const scout = await createScoutAgent(agentId)
const result = await scout.run()
```

#### 3. OpportunityBot
**File**: `lib/ai/agents/opportunity-bot.ts`
**Purpose**: Autonomous deal finder

**Features**:
- Finds companies matching ICP criteria
- Scores opportunities (fit + signals + activity)
- Ranks by priority
- Sends notifications for hot leads

**Usage**:
```typescript
const bot = await createOpportunityBot(agentId)
const result = await bot.run()
```

### API Routes

- `GET  /api/agents` - List all agents
- `POST /api/agents` - Create new agent
- `POST /api/agents/[id]/run` - Execute agent on-demand

### What's Working

✅ Agent configuration and storage
✅ Execution tracking with metrics
✅ Buying signal detection
✅ Scout Agent (monitors for signals)
✅ OpportunityBot (finds qualified leads)
✅ API for managing agents

### Next Steps

1. Apply agent migration to production
2. Create agents via API
3. Test agent execution
4. Build admin UI for agent management
5. Add background job scheduling (Inngest)



## Week 3: Background Jobs with Inngest ✅

### What is Inngest?

- Secure event communication

### Inngest Functions

#### 1. Execute Agent (`lib/inngest/functions/execute-agent.ts`)
- Runs any agent in background
- Tracks execution with steps
- Handles notifications
- Schedules next run

#### 2. Generate Embedding (`lib/inngest/functions/generate-embedding.ts`)
- Background embedding generation
- Uses Ollama (free)
- Automatic retries (3x)
- Rate limited (100/min)

#### 3. Daily Opportunity Scan (`lib/inngest/functions/daily-opportunity-scan.ts`)
- **Cron**: Daily at 9am UTC
- Runs all OpportunityBot agents
- Fully autonomous

#### 4. Daily Signal Monitor (`lib/inngest/functions/daily-signal-monitor.ts`)
- **Cron**: Daily at 8am UTC

- Cleans up expired signals

### API Updates
**File**: `app/api/agents/[agentId]/run/route.ts`
- Async execution (default) - queues with Inngest
- Sync execution (optional) - immediate response
- 202 Accepted for async jobs

### Usage

#### Run Agent Asynchronously
```bash
curl -X POST /api/agents/[agent-id]/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"async": true}'
```

#### Trigger via Code
```typescript
import { triggerAgent } from '@/lib/inngest/trigger-agent'

await triggerAgent(agentId, orgId, input)
```

### Setup

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Inngest dev server
npx inngest-cli@latest dev

# Terminal 2: Start Next.js
npm run dev

# Open Inngest dashboard
# http://localhost:8288
```

#### Production (Vercel)
