# Development Log

## Task T012: Contract Test for GET /api/data-room/documents

### Summary
Created T012 contract test at `tests/contract/documents-list.spec.ts`

### Test Coverage
The test covers:
- List all documents in a data room
- Filter by document_type, folder_path, and search term
- Sorting by created_at, filename, and file_size
- Pagination with limit/offset
- Required parameter validation
- Access control (403/404 scenarios)
- Processing status and classification fields
- Combined filters
- Total count header for pagination

### Expected Behavior
These tests will fail until the GET /api/data-room/documents endpoint (T033) is implemented.

### File Location
`tests/contract/documents-list.spec.ts`

### Status
✅ Completed

## Task T013: Contract Test for GET /api/data-room/documents/[id]

### Summary
Created T013 contract test at `tests/contract/documents-get.spec.ts`

### Test Coverage
The test covers:
- Return document with signed URL
- Validate signed URL is downloadable
- Include document_type and confidence_score if classified
- Include AI-extracted metadata
- Log view activity
- 404 for non-existent documents
- 403 for unauthorized access
- Signed URL with 1-hour expiration
- Include analysis data if available
- Storage path without exposing internal details
- Handle deleted documents gracefully
- Processing status for AI classification state
- Upload completion flag
- UUID format validation

### Expected Behavior
These tests will fail until the GET /api/data-room/documents/[id] endpoint (T034) is implemented.

### File Location
`tests/contract/documents-get.spec.ts`

### Status
✅ Completed

## AI Infrastructure Implementation - Week 1: Vector Search

### Task 1.1: Enable pgvector Extension ✅
Created migration file with pgvector extension, HNSW index, and similarity search functions.

### Task 1.2: Embedding Service ✅  
Created comprehensive embedding service with batch processing, semantic search, and cost tracking.


### Task 1.3: Semantic Search API ✅
**File**: `app/api/search/semantic/route.ts`

- Natural language search using vector embeddings
- Supports GET and POST methods
- Returns enriched company data with similarity scores
- Configurable limit and threshold

### Task 1.4: Generate Embeddings API ✅
**File**: `app/api/embeddings/generate/route.ts`

- Batch embedding generation (up to 100 at once)
- Support for specific companies or all without embeddings
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Statistics endpoint (GET)

### Task 1.5: Similar Companies API ✅
**File**: `app/api/companies/similar/route.ts`

- Find companies similar to a given company
- Vector similarity search
- Configurable threshold and limit
- Source company context included

## Week 1 Summary

**Completed**:
✅ pgvector database migration
✅ Embedding service (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
✅ Semantic search API
✅ Embedding generation API
✅ Similar companies API

**What's Working**:
- Generate embeddings for companies
- Semantic search by natural language
- Find similar companies using vector similarity
- Batch processing (100 companies at once)
- Cost tracking and monitoring

**Next Steps**:
1. Apply pgvector migration to production
2. Generate embeddings for existing companies
3. Test semantic search with real queries
4. Begin Week 2: AI Agents Infrastructure
