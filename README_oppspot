---------------------------
1. Fix Test Configuration
  # Set environment variable to match dev server port
  export PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
  Or update playwright.config.ts to default to port 3000 instead of 3009.

  2. Verify Database Schema
  Check which migrations are actually applied to Supabase production
  database. The presence of 8 migration files suggests
  iteration/troubleshooting. Need to:
  - Identify the correct/latest migration to use
  - Verify tables collections, collection_items, collection_access exist
  - Verify active_collection_id column added to profiles table
  - Clean up unused migration files

  3. Run Tests to Validate API
  Once port is fixed and DB is confirmed:
  PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx playwright test
  tests/e2e/collections-api.spec.ts

  SHORT TERM (High Value - 2-3 hours)

  4. Add SaveToCollectionButton to Business Pages
  File: app/business/[id]/page.tsx or
  components/business/business-actions.tsx

    itemId={business.id}
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
  />

  5. Add SaveToCollectionButton to Research Reports
  File: components/research/research-report.tsx
  <SaveToCollectionButton
    itemType="report"
    itemId={reportId}
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
  />

  6. Integration Testing
  - Test full workflow: Create collection → Save business → View in
  collection
  - Test sharing workflow
  - Test archive/restore workflow

  CLEANUP (Production Ready - 1-2 hours)

  7. Database Migration Cleanup

  - Add usage examples to CLAUDE.md
  - Create user-facing documentation

  9. Final Validation
  # Run all tests
  npm run test:e2e:collections

  # Type check
  npx tsc --noEmit

  Would you like me to:
  1. 
  2. Move to API routes (56 'any' types)?
  3. Tackle integrations/research-gpt (34 'any' types)?
  4. Take a different approach (e.g., focus on specific features)?

Technical Debt Summary

  Critical Issues (Blocking Build Quality)

  - 3,409 TypeScript errors (builds only work because ignoreBuildErrors: 
  true)
  - 
  - 574 explicit any types
  - 676 unused variables
  - 41 TODO/FIXME comments

  Most Common TypeScript Errors

  1. Type mismatches - ImportProgress, ImportStats missing properties
  2. never type issues - Database types resolving to never
  3. Null safety - Properties accessed without null checks
  4. JSON type assertions - Improper handling of JSON fields

  Breakdown by Category

  
  2. Unused Code (676 instances)
    - Remove unused imports
    - Clean up unused variables (e.g., _request, testMode)
  3. Database Types (Major issue)
    - Many tables resolve to never type
    - lib/supabase/database.types.ts needs regeneration
    - Missing properties in scan/import types
  4. Null Safety (Hundreds of issues)
    - Missing null checks (property is possibly 'null')
    - Optional chaining needed

  Files Needing Most Attention

  - app/admin/companies-house/page.tsx - ImportStats/ImportProgress types
  - app/api/acquisition-scans/** - Database type issues (never types)
  - app/admin/import/page.tsx - Event data type safety

  Current Workaround

  // next.config.ts
  eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true
  typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true

  Would you like me to start fixing any specific category? I'd recommend
  tackling them in this order:
  1. Fix database types (fixes ~40% of errors)
  2. Replace any types with proper interfaces
  3. Add null safety checks
  4. Clean up unused variables















------------------------------------------------------



INNGEST
npx inngest-cli@latest dev

------------------------------
-----------------------------


  Immediate (This Week)

  1. Fix TypeScript config - Exclude test files:
  // tsconfig.json
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "tests", "**/*.spec.ts"]
  1. This alone eliminates ~800 errors.
  2. Regenerate database types:
  npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id fuqdbewftdthbjfcecrz >
  types/database.ts
  2. Should fix ~600 never type errors.

  Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)

  3. Fix top 10 files with most any types
  4. Clean up unused imports (~40 instances)
  5. Re-enable strict TypeScript checking progressively

  Medium Term (Next Month)

  6. Implement stubbed TODO items (billing, notifications, etc.)
  7. Replace remaining ~400 any types systematically
  8. Add proper error handling for unknown types





















----------------------------------------


Step-by-Step Local Inngest Setup

  1. Terminal 1: Start Inngest Dev Server ✅ (Already running)

  The Inngest dev server is already running at http://localhost:8288 - good!

  2. Terminal 2: Start Next.js Dev Server ❌ (Not running)

  Open a new terminal in the oppspot directory and start your app:

  cd /home/vik/oppspot
  npm run dev

  This should start on http://localhost:3000 (or 3001/3002 if 3000 is busy)

  3. Verify Connection

  Once both are running, check the connection:

  # Check if Next.js is running
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/inngest

  # Should return something like:
  # {"mode":"dev","has_event_key":false,"has_signing_key":false,"function_co
  unt":4}

  4. Check Inngest Dashboard

  1. Open http://localhost:8288 in your browser
  2. You should see the Inngest dev UI
  3. Navigate to Functions tab
  4. You should see your 4 functions:
    - Execute Agent
    - Generate Embedding
    - Daily Opportunity Scan
    - Daily Signal Monitor

  5. Test Agent Execution

  Now when you trigger an agent from your app:

  1. Events will appear immediately in http://localhost:8288
  2. Go to Stream or Runs tab to see execution logs
  3. You'll see real-time updates as the agent runs







--------------------------------------



---------------------------

  Option 2: Local Development Dashboard

  If you want to test locally:

  # Terminal 1: Start Inngest dev server
  npx inngest-cli@latest dev

  # Terminal 2: Start Next.js
  npm run dev

  # Then open: http://localhost:8288

  ---


  The dashboard at https://app.inngest.com will show you all the activity,
  logs, and any errors from these scheduled jobs!



-----------------------------



  1. Create a Companies House bulk importer (fastest way to get 5M UK companies)
  2. 
  3. Set up update workflows (daily/weekly data refresh)
  4. Add buying signal detection (job postings, funding news)



------------------------


---------------------------

  Remaining Technical Debt (Non-Blocking):

  - 470 'any' types in lib/ and API routes - Should be addressed
  incrementally over time
  - ~20 unused variables - Mostly with _ prefix (intentionally unused
  parameters)
  - TypeScript strict mode still disabled in next.config.ts (by design per
  CLAUDE.md)


 Remaining breakdown:
  - 🔴 High Priority (144 types)
    - lib/qualification: 88 types
    - app/api routes: 56 types
  - 🟡 Medium Priority (34 types)
    - lib/integrations: 18 types
    - lib/research-gpt: 16 types
  - 🟢 Low Priority (~272 types)
    - Other lib/* modules

  The build compiles successfully and all pages work! Would you like me to
  continue fixing more 'any' types? I can tackle the high-priority modules
  (lib/qualification with 88 types, or remaining API routes with 56 types)
  to make more substantial progress.
