INNGEST
npx inngest-cli@latest dev


----------------------------------------


Step-by-Step Local Inngest Setup

  1. Terminal 1: Start Inngest Dev Server ✅ (Already running)

  The Inngest dev server is already running at http://localhost:8288 - good!

  2. Terminal 2: Start Next.js Dev Server ❌ (Not running)

  Open a new terminal in the oppspot directory and start your app:

  cd /home/vik/oppspot
  npm run dev

  This should start on http://localhost:3000 (or 3001/3002 if 3000 is busy)

  3. Verify Connection

  Once both are running, check the connection:

  # Check if Next.js is running
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/inngest

  # Should return something like:
  # {"mode":"dev","has_event_key":false,"has_signing_key":false,"function_co
  unt":4}

  4. Check Inngest Dashboard

  1. Open http://localhost:8288 in your browser
  2. You should see the Inngest dev UI
  3. Navigate to Functions tab
  4. You should see your 4 functions:
    - Execute Agent
    - Generate Embedding
    - Daily Opportunity Scan
    - Daily Signal Monitor

  5. Test Agent Execution

  Now when you trigger an agent from your app:

  1. Events will appear immediately in http://localhost:8288
  2. Go to Stream or Runs tab to see execution logs
  3. You'll see real-time updates as the agent runs







--------------------------------------



---------------------------

  Option 2: Local Development Dashboard

  If you want to test locally:

  # Terminal 1: Start Inngest dev server
  npx inngest-cli@latest dev

  # Terminal 2: Start Next.js
  npm run dev

  # Then open: http://localhost:8288

  ---
  What You Can Monitor:

  - Daily Opportunity Scan - Runs at 9am UTC daily
  - Daily Signal Monitor - Runs at 8am UTC daily
  - Agent Executions - Any background agent runs
  - Embedding Generation - AI embedding jobs

  The dashboard at https://app.inngest.com will show you all the activity,
  logs, and any errors from these scheduled jobs!



-----------------------------



  1. Create a Companies House bulk importer (fastest way to get 5M UK companies)
  2. 
  3. Set up update workflows (daily/weekly data refresh)
  4. Add buying signal detection (job postings, funding news)



------------------------


---------------------------

  Remaining Technical Debt (Non-Blocking):

  - 470 'any' types in lib/ and API routes - Should be addressed
  incrementally over time
  - ~20 unused variables - Mostly with _ prefix (intentionally unused
  parameters)
  - TypeScript strict mode still disabled in next.config.ts (by design per
  CLAUDE.md)


 Remaining breakdown:
  - 🔴 High Priority (144 types)
    - lib/qualification: 88 types
    - app/api routes: 56 types
  - 🟡 Medium Priority (34 types)
    - lib/integrations: 18 types
    - lib/research-gpt: 16 types
  - 🟢 Low Priority (~272 types)
    - Other lib/* modules

  The build compiles successfully and all pages work! Would you like me to
  continue fixing more 'any' types? I can tackle the high-priority modules
  (lib/qualification with 88 types, or remaining API routes with 56 types)
  to make more substantial progress.

  Use Cases for oppSpot:

  1. Similar company discovery: "Find companies like Stripe"
  2. Semantic stakeholder search: "Find CTOs interested in AI/ML"
  3. Deal matching: "Which deals match this success story?"
  4. Content recommendations: "Relevant case studies for this prospect"




  Would you like me to:
  1. 
  2. Integrate these components into the existing stream wizard?
  3. Or start implementing the agent execution logic?

     3. Fix checklist-engine.ts - same approach  
     4. Fix lead-routing-engine.ts - same approach
     5. Fix missing OpenRouterService export in @/lib/ai/openrouter

     Phase 2: Replace any Types (9 errors)

     6. Fix app/(dashboard)/ai-scoring/page.tsx:149
     7. Fix app/api/webhooks/qualification/route.ts (3 instances)
     8. Search and fix remaining any types across codebase

     Phase 3: Fix React Hook Dependencies (10+ warnings)

     9. Add missing dependencies to useEffect hooks or wrap in useCallback

     Phase 4: Clean Up Unused Variables (15+ warnings)

     10. Remove unused imports and variables

     Phase 5: Fix JSX Issues (Low priority)
