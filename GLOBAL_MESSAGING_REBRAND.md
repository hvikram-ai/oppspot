## 🎓 Copywriting Insights

### **What Worked Well**

1. **AI-First Narrative**
   - "AI that finds deals you didn't know existed" - Compelling, benefit-driven
   - Positions AI as proactive intelligence, not just a tool

2. **Specific Geographic Scope**
   - "200+ countries" - Concrete, credible
   - "Every continent" - Aspirational yet achievable

3. **24/7 Intelligence Angle**
   - "Intelligence that never sleeps" - Unique differentiator
   - Emphasizes competitive advantage for time-sensitive M&A

4. **Audience-Specific Language**
   - "Acquisition targets" (not "business opportunities") - PE/M&A jargon
   - "Deal intelligence" (not "business intelligence") - Industry-specific

### **Lessons Learned**

✅ **Be Specific**: "Global" is vague; "200+ countries" is concrete
✅ **Lead with Benefit**: "AI that finds deals..." (benefit) > "AI-powered platform" (feature)
✅ **Match Jargon**: Use industry language ("acquisition targets" for M&A, not "companies")
✅ **Aspirational but Credible**: "Worldwide" works if backed by "millions of companies tracked"
