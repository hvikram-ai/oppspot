## ⚠️ What's Left to Complete MVP

### 1. Run Database Migration 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251002000009_data_room_schema.sql`

**How to Apply**:
```bash
# Option 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fuqdbewftdthbjfcecrz
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Paste migration file contents
4. Execute

# Option 2: Supabase CLI (if installed)
supabase db push
```

**What it creates**:
- 6 tables with RLS policies
- 9 enum types
- 4 triggers for auto-updates
- 4 helper functions
- Optimized indexes

---

### 2. Document Upload API 🟡 **NEXT PRIORITY**

**File to Create**: `app/api/data-rooms/[id]/documents/route.ts`

**What it needs**:
```typescript
// Upload document to Supabase Storage
// Create document record in database
// Trigger AI classification
// Update data room metrics
// Log activity
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Accept file upload via multipart/form-data
2. Upload to Supabase Storage bucket `data-room-documents`
3. Insert record into `documents` table
4. Trigger background AI classification job
5. Return document ID

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### 3. AI Document Classifier 🟡 **NEXT PRIORITY**

**File to Create**: `lib/data-room/ai/classifier.ts`

**What it does**:

- Legal (incorporation, legal opinions)
- HR (org charts, employee lists)
- Other (uncategorized)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### 4. Supabase Storage Bucket 🟡 **REQUIRED**

**Create Bucket**: `data-room-documents`

**Configuration**:
```typescript
{
  name: 'data-room-documents',
  public: false,
  fileSizeLimit: 104857600, // 100MB
  allowedMimeTypes: [
    'application/pdf',
    'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.*',
    'text/csv',
    'image/jpeg',
    'image/png',
    'text/plain'
  ]
}
```

**RLS Policies**:
- Editors can upload
- Viewers can download
- Activity logged for all access

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

## 🎓 Learning & Documentation

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Soft Delete vs Hard Delete**
   - Chose soft delete (deleted_at field) for compliance
   - Allows recovery and audit trail preservation
   - Can implement auto-purge after 30 days

2. **RLS Policies vs Application Logic**
   - Used RLS for security enforcement
   - Prevents data leaks even if app logic fails
   - Performance is acceptable with proper indexes

3. **Activity Logs Immutability**
   - No UPDATE or DELETE on activity_logs table
   - Append-only for compliance (GDPR, SOC 2)
   - Uses triggers to prevent modification

4. **Permission Levels**
   - Owner: Full control, can delete
   - Editor: Upload, annotate, generate reports
   - Viewer: Read-only, download with watermark
   - Commenter: Add notes, no download

5. **Document Type Classification**
   - 6 types: Financial, Contract, DD, Legal, HR, Other
   - Extensible enum for future types
   - Confidence score for uncertain classifications
