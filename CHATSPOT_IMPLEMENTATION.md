## Key Features

### üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Queries

**Instead of complex forms, users can ask:**
```
"Find fintech companies in London that raised money this year and are hiring engineers"

"Research Revolut"

"Find companies similar to Stripe"

"Which accounts are showing buying signals?"

"Who should I contact at Monzo about our product?"

"Show me SaaS companies that raised Series A but exclude anyone we contacted"
```

### üß† AI-Powered Intent Recognition

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet extracts:**
- **Intent type** - What user wants to do
- **Parameters** - Industries, locations, company size, funding, tech stack, keywords
- **Confidence** - How sure we are about the intent
- **Suggested actions** - What we can do next

**Example:**
```typescript
User: "Find fintech companies in London that raised money this year"

Intent Recognition:
{
  type: "search_companies",
  confidence: 0.95,
  parameters: {
    industries: ["fintech"],
    locations: ["London"],
    keywords: ["raised funding"],
    date_range: { from: "2025-01-01" }
  },
  suggested_actions: [
    { type: "search", label: "Search companies" },
    { type: "research", label: "Research top 5" },
    { type: "add_to_list", label: "Save to list" }
  ]
}
```

### üí¨ Conversational Context

- Builds on previous searches
- Understands follow-up questions

**Example:**
```
User: "Find fintech companies in London"
ChatSpot: "Found 47 companies..."

User: "Show me the top 5"
ChatSpot: "Here are the top 5..." (remembers previous search)

User: "Research the first one"
